## Practical Implementation

Let's look at a real-world example using PyPDF2, a popular Python-based PDF SDK. This code demonstrates how to merge multiple PDFs and add watermarks:

```python
from PyPDF2 import PdfWriter, PdfReader

def merge_and_watermark_pdfs(pdf_files, watermark_file, output_file):
    # Initialize PDF writer
    merger = PdfWriter()
    
    # Load watermark
    watermark = PdfReader(watermark_file).pages[0]
    
    # Process each PDF
    for pdf_path in pdf_files:
        reader = PdfReader(pdf_path)
        
        # Add each page with watermark
        for page in reader.pages:
            page.merge_page(watermark)
            merger.add_page(page)
    
    # Save the merged and watermarked PDF
    with open(output_file, 'wb') as output:
        merger.write(output)
    
    return True
```
